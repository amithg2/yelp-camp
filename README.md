# Yelp Camp

This is my first full stack project. This project is part of fullStack curse i took. Yelp Camp is a website for travelers, you can add campgrounds and view campgrounds and reviews.  The main technologies i used to build this website are: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap and Mapbox.
